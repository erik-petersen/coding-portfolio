    <p>
      Thanks for visiting my site. A little about me...I am currently volunteering as programmer writing automated tests for
      a company in Cary, NC.  I love coding, take pride in my work, and enjoy seeing code that I write do something helpful for
      people. I'm amazed and excited about how many frameworks and technologies there are to utilize and I enjoy spending time
      learning them. At the moment, I'm exploring Bootstrap, PHP, and diving deeper into Angular.

      <p>
        Homeshare was our final project at The Iron Yard.  The mobile app was created to allow roommates or family members stay organized
        with daily household chores and have fun while doing it! Our group cross-collaborated by using an Angular front-end that spoke
        to a Rails back-end.
