      Thanks for visiting my site. A little about me...I am currently volunteering as programmer writing automated tests for
      a company in Cary, NC.  I love coding, take pride in my work, and enjoy seeing code that I write do something helpful for
      people. I'm amazed and excited about how many frameworks and technologies there are to utilize and I enjoy spending time
      learning them. At the moment, I'm exploring Bootstrap, PHP, and diving deeper into Angular.

          Homeshare was our final project at The Iron Yard.  The mobile app was created to allow roommates or family members stay organized
          with daily household chores and have fun while doing it! Our group cross-collaborated by using an Angular front-end that spoke
          to a Rails back-end.

          Yes, we cloned Etsy.  What tech education would be complete without the shady cloning of a popular website?  Our entire
            class came together.  My partner and I took on the categories page using an Angular front-end talking to Etsy's API
            in order to bring in everything that populates the page.  We made use of localstorage when a user clicks on an item.

          The Catalan Opening is a popular chess opening that was created in the 1920s.  In this app, I used jQuery to
          navigate forward and backward through the first nine moves.  There is also an optional play/pause feature.
