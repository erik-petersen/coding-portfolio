  <p class="about-me-text p1">Thanks for visiting my site. A little about me...I am currently volunteering as a programmer
    writing automated tests for a company in Cary, NC. I love coding, take pride in my work, and enjoy seeing code that I write
    do something helpful for people. I'm amazed and excited about how many frameworks and technologies there are to utilize and
    I enjoy spending time learning them. At the moment, I'm exploring Bootstrap, PHP, and diving deeper into Angular.
