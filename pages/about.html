  <p class="about-me-text">Thanks for visiting my site.  A little about me and why the baking theme on my site.  I came to coding
  from the baking and restaurant world, with a brief stint as a 911 telecommunicator.  I came to find that coding is actually
  a lot like baking.  Both occupations manipulate ingredients using tools.</p>
  <p class="about-me-text p2">In coding, the ingredients are things like HTML
  elements and CSS styles.  Add too much, too little, or the wrong ingredient and things are not going to come out right
  and it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  In the end, you get to see the product of your labor and smile.</p>
