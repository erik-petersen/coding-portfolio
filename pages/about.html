  <p class="about-me-text p1">Thanks for visiting my site.  A little about me and why the baking theme on my site.  I came to coding
  from the baking and restaurant world, with a brief stint as a 911 telecommunicator.  I came to find that coding is actually
  a lot like baking.  Both occupations manipulate ingredients using tools.  Both occupations allow me to take pride in my work and
  I enjoy seeing the finished product.</p>
  <p class="about-me-text p2">I love manipulating ingredients and I love manipulating code.  I'm amazed and excited about how many
  frameworks and technologies there are to utilize.  Since graduating from The Iron Yard, I've enjoyed spending time learning some
  of these new tools.  At the moment, I'm exploring Bootstrap and diving deeper into Angular.</p>
