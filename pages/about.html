  <p class="about-me-text p1">Thanks for visiting my site. A little about me...After graduating from The Iron Yard coding bootcamp,
    I volunteered as a programmer writing automated tests in PHP for a company in Cary, NC. I love coding, take pride in my work, and enjoy 
    seeing code that I write do something helpful for people. I am amazed and excited about how many frameworks and technologies there
    are to utilize and I enjoy spending time learning them. At the moment, I am spending time with Treehouse videos trying to dive deeper into
    SQL and PHP.
